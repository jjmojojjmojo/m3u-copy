## M3U COPY

A simple application to parse an M3U playlist, and copy it and referenced files to a new location.

The need for this comes from wanting to create playlists for my car's MP3-capable stereo system - I'd like to construct a list in an application like Clementine, and then easily transfer those files and the playlist itself to an SD card. 

## TECH
I'm using clojure, and boot for this project.

## NOTE
I'm sure something like this exists somewhere :) This project exists mostly for my own edification - this is an early hobby clojure project for me.

## FUTURE
I have ideas for the near-term once the basic functionality is complete:
  - use swing or another UI toolkit (QT has bindings for java) to construct a playlist manager application.
  - add playlist generation capabilities.
